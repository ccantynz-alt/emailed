# ALECRAE — THE BIBLE

> **This document is the single source of truth for AlecRae.**
> **Read it FIRST. Reference it ALWAYS. Violate it NEVER.**

---

## ⚡ THE PRIME DIRECTIVE

**AlecRae kills Gmail. AlecRae kills Outlook. AlecRae kills Superhuman.**

Email has not been reinvented since 2004. We are the reinvention. There is no second place. We dominate or we die. Every line of code, every component, every decision, every commit must serve this mission.

**The standard:** 80-90% ahead of every competitor at all times. Not 10%. Not 30%. Eighty to ninety percent.

If a competitor closes the gap, we accelerate. If new technology threatens our lead, we absorb it or destroy the need for it. We are not in a race — we are lapping the field.

---

## 📖 THE BIBLE RULE

**Before ANY new build, ANY refactor, ANY significant change — READ THIS FILE FIRST.**

This file is read at the start of every session. It is referenced before every architectural decision. It is updated at the end of every session. No work happens outside the framework defined here.

**No scatter-gun. No drift. No "just this once."** Every action ties back to this document.

---

## 👑 THE BOSS RULE — CRAIG MUST AUTHORIZE

The following actions require **explicit authorization from Craig (the boss/owner) BEFORE execution**:

1. **Major architectural changes** — swapping frameworks, changing core stack, altering data model
2. **New dependencies that aren't already in the approved stack** — we don't add bloat
3. **Pricing changes** — any modification to plans, tiers, or billing logic
4. **Domain or DNS changes** — anything touching alecrae.com or its subdomains
5. **Production deployments** — first-time deploy and any rollback
6. **Stripe configuration** — webhook URLs, price IDs, plan structures
7. **Schema migrations on production database** — irreversible changes need sign-off
8. **External API integrations** — adding new third-party services
9. **Brand/marketing changes** — copy on landing page, logos, taglines
10. **Anything that touches money, users' data, or public-facing communication**

**The rule:** When in doubt, ask Craig. Cost of asking = 30 seconds. Cost of acting wrong = days of damage.

**The exception:** Craig has pre-authorized continuous building of features within the existing build plan and stack. Routine code, bug fixes, refactors within the approved architecture, and committing/pushing to the development branch do NOT require additional authorization.

---

## 🎯 THE MISSION

Build the fastest, smartest, most beautiful, most aggressive email client ever made. One subscription. Every account. Every device. Every language. AI in every layer. No ads. No data mining. No bloat. No compromise.

**The customer sees:** Magic. Speed. Beauty. Their email actually works.
**The competition sees:** A force they cannot match without rebuilding from scratch.
**Craig sees:** Recurring revenue with 85%+ margins on a moat that compounds over time.

## ⚔️ THE AGGRESSIVE ARCHITECTURE

### Three-Tier Compute Model
```
CLIENT GPU (WebGPU) ──→ EDGE (Cloudflare Workers) ──→ CLOUD (Modal GPUs)
       $0/token              sub-50ms                    Full H100 power
       sub-10ms              lightweight inference        heavy AI / training
       grammar/triage        compose/translate            voice profile train
```

The platform decides where each request runs based on cost, latency, and capability. **The user never sees the tier. They just see speed.**

### Local-First Architecture
- All emails cached in IndexedDB on first sync
- UI reads from local cache (sub-50ms)
- Background workers sync changes to/from server
- Offline support out of the box
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

### Edge-First Deployment
- Every API route deployable to Cloudflare Workers
- Sub-50ms response times globally
- No regional bottlenecks
- Stateful workloads (MTA, WebSocket) on Fly.io microVMs

### AI-Native Architecture
**AI is woven into every layer, not bolted on:**
- AI in routing (predictive prefetch)
- AI in data fetching (smart cache invalidation)
- AI in UI (adaptive density, smart suggestions)
- AI in error recovery (self-healing)
- AI in search (natural language)
- AI in compose (voice profile + grammar agent)
- AI in triage (priority inbox + commitments)
- AI in security (threat detection)

### Component Architecture
- **ZERO HTML in app code.** Everything is a component.
- Every component has a Zod schema for AI composition
- Every component is themeable, accessible, keyboard-navigable
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Storybook for visual testing (when added)

## 🛡️ THE QUALITY BAR

### Performance Budgets — CI FAILS IF VIOLATED
| Metric | Budget |
|---|---|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.0s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 1.5s |
| Time to Interactive | < 2.0s |
| Inbox load (cached) | < 100ms |
| Inbox load (cold) | < 1.5s |
| Search response | < 50ms (local), < 200ms (server) |
| API response (edge) | < 50ms p99 |
| API response (cloud) | < 200ms p99 |
| AI response (client) | < 200ms |
| AI response (edge) | < 500ms |
| AI response (cloud) | < 2s |
| Initial JS bundle | < 100KB |
| Email send time-to-delivered | < 2s |

### Code Standards — NO EXCEPTIONS
- TypeScript strict mode (`strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`)
- No `any`. No `@ts-ignore`. No `as unknown as X`. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- Every function has explicit return types
- Every prop has explicit types
- Every API boundary has Zod validation
- Every error case has typed handling (Result types preferred over try/catch for business logic)
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `chore:`
- All public APIs have OpenAPI specs
- All endpoints have integration tests
- All components have visual snapshots
- Biome formats and lints — no ESLint, no Prettier

### Component Rules
- ZERO raw HTML elements outside of `packages/ui` primitives
- Every component must be accessible (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen reader friendly)
- Every component must support themes (light/dark/system + accent colors)
- No inline styles — Tailwind classes or CSS modules only
- No CSS-in-JS runtime (build-time only)
- Server Components by default

### AI Integration Rules
- All AI calls have fallback behavior if AI is unavailable
- AI decisions are logged and auditable
- Confidence scores accompany all classifications
- User data used for AI must be anonymizable
- Model selection is automatic based on task complexity
- All AI interactions are traced via OpenTelemetry
- Destructive AI actions require human-in-the-loop approval

### Accessibility — CHARLIE BROWN TO 007
**AlecRae must work for novices AND experts equally well:**
- WCAG 2.2 AA minimum (target AAA where possible)
- Full keyboard navigation (every action has a shortcut)
- Screen reader optimization (real ARIA, real focus management)
- Voice control (dictation engine + command palette)
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion mode
- Adjustable density (compact/comfortable/spacious)
- Adjustable font sizes (small/medium/large)
- Color blind safe palettes
- Minimum touch target 44x44px on mobile

### Security Requirements
- No secrets in code — env vars or secrets manager only
- All inter-service communication over TLS 1.3
- Rate limiting on every public endpoint (already done — 6 tiers)
- Input validation at every boundary (Zod)
- CSP headers on all web responses
- HSTS preloading
- Regular dependency audits (Renovate + Dependabot)
- E2E encryption for users who enable it
- Zero-knowledge architecture for encrypted content
- No third-party trackers, no analytics that send PII off-server

## ❌ THE FORBIDDEN LIST

**NEVER do these things. Ever. Without exception:**

1. **Never write raw HTML in app code.** Components only.
2. **Never use `any` type.** Use `unknown` and narrow.
3. **Never use `@ts-ignore`.** Fix the type.
4. **Never commit secrets.** Env vars only.
5. **Never skip tests for "speed."** Untested code does not exist.
6. **Never use external JavaScript trackers.** No Google Analytics, no Hotjar, no Mixpanel-as-default.
7. **Never sell user data.** Period. This is the moat.
8. **Never show ads in the email client.** We're not Gmail.
9. **Never break the local cache contract.** Reads from cache must always return.
10. **Never deploy to production without Craig's authorization.**
11. **Never modify Stripe configuration without Craig's authorization.**
12. **Never add a dependency that isn't in the approved stack without Craig's authorization.**
13. **Never delete user data without explicit user action AND a 30-day soft-delete window.**
14. **Never ship a feature that isn't accessible.** If a screen reader can't use it, it's broken.
15. **Never use `localStorage` for sensitive data.** IndexedDB with encryption only.
16. **Never trust user input.** Validate everything with Zod.
17. **Never block on a single AI provider.** Always have a fallback path.
18. **Never let an error bubble unhandled to the user.** Wrap, log, recover, retry.
19. **Never silently fail.** Errors are visible to monitoring.
20. **Never ship a feature without a CLAUDE.md update.** This file is the source of truth.
21. **Never approve a PR you didn't read end-to-end.**
22. **Never use the word "Vienna" or "Emailed" in user-facing copy.** It's AlecRae.
23. **Never refer to competitors by name in marketing.** Show, don't tell.
24. **Never make up user metrics for marketing.** Real numbers or no numbers.
25. **Never let speed be an excuse for sloppiness.** Move fast WITHOUT breaking things.

- **Context:** What's the problem?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Alternatives:** What did we consider?
- **Consequences:** What does this mean going forward?
- **Status:** Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded

Major past decisions:
- ADR-0001: Use Neon over Supabase (serverless economics)
- ADR-0002: Use Cloudflare over Vercel (cost + edge presence)
- ADR-0003: Bun over Node.js (speed)
- ADR-0004: Hono over Express (4x faster, edge-compatible)
- ADR-0005: Tailwind over CSS-in-JS (zero runtime cost)
- ADR-0006: Drizzle over Prisma (smaller bundle, edge-friendly)
- ADR-0007: Claude over GPT (better instruction following, faster improvement)

## 🎯 THE COMPETITIVE MANDATE

**We are not building "another email client." We are building the LAST email client.**

Every feature must answer: "Why would someone switch from Gmail/Outlook for this?"

If the answer isn't compelling, don't build it. If it is, build it 10x better than the competition.

**Examples of compelling answers:**
- "AlecRae's grammar agent replaces Grammarly, which costs $30/mo. AlecRae includes it free."
- "AlecRae's dictation lets you reply by voice with email-aware commands. Dragon is dead. Nothing else does this."
- "AlecRae's email recall actually works. Outlook's is theater."
- "AlecRae's AI learns YOUR writing style. Gmail's AI sounds like a robot."
- "AlecRae runs on YOUR computer's GPU for free AI. Gmail charges $30/mo for Gemini."
- "AlecRae's commitments tracker catches every promise made in email. Gmail catches none."
- "AlecRae unifies Gmail + Outlook + Yahoo + iCloud in one inbox. Superhuman is Gmail-only."

**Examples of bad answers (don't build):**
- "It would be cool"
- "Other apps have it"
- "It's a small change"

## ⚖️ THE BIBLE RULE (REPRISE)

**This file is the source of truth.**

If something contradicts this file, this file wins.
If you don't know what to do, this file tells you.
If you want to change this file, Craig has to approve it.
If you ship something not in this file, you broke the rules.

**No scatter-gun. No drift. No "just this once."**

**AlecRae dominates or AlecRae dies. There is no second place.**

## 🚀 FASTEST PATH TO LIVE URL ON CRAIG'S iPad

**Option A: Cloudflare Pages (recommended — matches our stack)**
1. dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git
2. Authorize GitHub → select `ccantynz-alt/alecrae.com`
3. Branch: `claude/rebrand-to-alecrae-HKMR4`
4. Build command: `cd apps/web && bun install && bun run build`
5. Output: `apps/web/.next`
6. Click Deploy → Free `*.pages.dev` URL in ~3 min

**Option B: Vercel (simpler, faster setup)**
1. vercel.com → New Project → Import `ccantynz-alt/alecrae.com`
2. Root directory: `apps/web`
3. Click Deploy → `*.vercel.app` URL in ~60 sec

**Either path = working URL on iPad/mobile. No backend needed for the landing page.**

## 🏗️ THE BIGGER PICTURE — ALECRAE AS FLAGSHIP

Craig is also building a **Render+Vercel+AI hybrid platform** (the "Back to the Future" infrastructure). AlecRae will eventually deploy on this platform — making AlecRae both:
1. **A standalone product** that generates revenue
2. **The flagship reference app** that proves the underlying platform works

This is why we move with discipline: every architectural choice in AlecRae informs the platform underneath. We don't build AlecRae in a way that requires the platform to ship first — AlecRae deploys to Cloudflare today, and migrates to the new platform when it's ready, with zero rewrites needed (because the new platform supports the same primitives).
